Bug Report: Our GUI is incapable of plotting the results of subsequent step responses without restarting the program. 
We narrowed the problem down to the data transmission not getting transmitted through the serial port, but cannot figure out why this is.
The results of our program sometimes change from run to run. This inconsistency makes debugging extraordinarily confusing.
